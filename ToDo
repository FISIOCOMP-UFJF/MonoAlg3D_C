- Correct the save file
- Implement options window for GUI
- Implement custom data savers, maybe...
- Re-enable the unit tests that were disabled after the library changes
- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data)
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
