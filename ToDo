#TODO
Create a execution database in the test suite to track for performance regressions:
http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html

Make a function to save a HDF5 database. With this we do not need to save the mesh every time steps, only the Vm values.
This will work only for non-adaptive meshes.

#BUGS:

The logger symbols are only exported to an executable if an static library linked to a shared library uses then. For now this is ok. But I think it will
be a pain in future releases.

#Generate computer HW Hash (very simple)
inxi -CNM |grep -e Topology  -e Device-1 | sha256sum
