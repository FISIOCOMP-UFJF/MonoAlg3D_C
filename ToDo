#TODO
Create a execution database in the test suite to track for performance regressions:

#Generate computer HW Hash (very simple)
inxi -CNM |grep -e Topology  -e Device-1 | sha256sum

Make a function to save a HDF5 database. With this we do not need to save the mesh every time steps, only the Vm values.
This will work only for non-adaptive meshes.

Report line number only for the debug build in the helpers functions.

Verify the possibility to not copy the SV from the GPU to the CPU when the ODE solver and the PDE solver are using the GPU.

#KNOW ISSUES:
The logger symbols are only exported to an executable if an static library linked to a shared library uses then. For now this is ok. But I think it will be a pain in future releases.
The GPU linear system solver is not working for purkinje-only simulations
