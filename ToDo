Sachetto
- Rewrite the flags parsing using: https://github.com/kgabis/kgflags/blob/master/examples/full_api.c
- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data)
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Rewrite some library APIs (maybe we need only the config to be passed to the library function)

Berg
- Merge the last modifications from Sachetto to my code and generate two branches (ShellScript build & CMake build)
	- Send a pull request to him

- Refactor the save map functions as a single one

- Implement coupling between Purkinje and tissue
    - Fix the retropropagation code
    - Solve the Purkinje linear system using the LINEAR_SYSTEM macro instead of another function
    - Fix a bug when using adaptativity (benchmark_purkinje.ini)
    - Add the option to configure the conductivity of the segments from the Purkinje network on the input ".vtk"

- Add a conduction velocity calculator for Purkinje fibers
- Implement the GMRES linear system solver (see Bernardo's book as reference ...)
- Implement a Purkinje restore state function
