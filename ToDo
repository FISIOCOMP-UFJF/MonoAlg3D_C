- Rewrite the flags parsing using: https://github.com/kgabis/kgflags/blob/master/examples/full_api.c
- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data)
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Rewrite some library APIs (maybe we need only the config to be passed to the library function)

- [Elnaz] Implement a script to calculate the APD's of every cell in the grid (use "getAps.sh" and "getAPD.py" together ...)
- Implement 'save_vtk_polydata_grid_as_vtu_compressed' function
- Implement coupling between Purkinje and tissue

Pedro
- Upgrade and refactor the DDM code.
- Rewrite the 'update_monodomain' function for the DDM case
- Implement the anisotropic case for the DDM.
